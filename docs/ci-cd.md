# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document explains our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline implemented with GitHub Actions.

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline automates the following processes:

1. **Code Quality Checks**

   - Linting (ESLint)
   - Type checking (TypeScript)
   - Unit testing (Jest)

2. **Build Verification**

   - Ensures the application builds successfully
   - Verifies Docker images can be built

3. **Security Scanning**

   - Scans for vulnerabilities using Trivy
   - Checks for critical and high-severity issues

4. **Docker Image Management**

   - Builds and pushes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry
   - Tags images appropriately for versioning

5. **Deployment** (Future Implementation)
   - Will deploy to production infrastructure
   - Currently a placeholder for future implementation

## Pipeline Triggers

The pipeline runs automatically when:

- Code is pushed to the `main` or `develop` branches
- A pull request is created targeting `main` or `develop`

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Lint and Type Check

- Runs ESLint to ensure code style consistency
- Performs TypeScript type checking
- Must pass before proceeding to testing

### 2. Test

- Runs unit tests with Jest
- Must pass before proceeding to build

### 3. Build

- Installs dependencies
- Builds the Next.js application
- Verifies the build succeeds

### 4. Security Scan

- Scans the codebase for vulnerabilities
- Fails if critical or high-severity issues are found

### 5. Docker Build and Push

- Only runs on the `main` branch
- Builds both development and production Docker images
- Pushes images to GitHub Container Registry
- Tags images with:
  - Branch name
  - Pull request number (for PRs)
  - Semantic version (for releases)
  - Git SHA (for traceability)

### 6. Deployment

- Currently a placeholder
- Will be implemented when infrastructure is ready
- Will only run on the `main` branch

## GitHub Secrets

The following secrets need to be configured in your GitHub repository:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

## How to Use

### For Developers

1. **Local Development**

   - Develop and test locally
   - Push to a feature branch
   - Create a pull request to `develop` or `main`

2. **Pull Requests**

   - The pipeline will automatically run on your PR
   - All checks must pass before merging
   - Review the pipeline results in the GitHub Actions tab

3. **Merging to Main**
   - When merging to `main`, the pipeline will:
     - Run all checks
     - Build and push Docker images
     - (Future) Deploy to production

### For Administrators

1. **Managing Secrets**

   - Go to repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add or update the required secrets

2. **Monitoring Pipeline**

   - View pipeline runs in the Actions tab
   - Set up notifications for pipeline failures

3. **Deployment Configuration**
   - When ready to deploy, update the `deploy` job in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
   - Configure deployment credentials as secrets

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Strategy**

   - Use feature branches for development
   - Merge to `develop` for testing
   - Merge to `main` for production

2. **Commit Messages**

   - Use conventional commits for better versioning
   - Include issue references when applicable

3. **Pull Requests**

   - Require reviews before merging
   - Ensure all pipeline checks pass
   - Keep PRs focused and small

4. **Security**
   - Never commit secrets or credentials
   - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
   - Regularly update dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pipeline Failures**

   - Check the specific job that failed
   - Review logs for error messages
   - Fix issues locally and push changes

2. **Docker Build Issues**

   - Verify Dockerfile syntax
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Ensure proper permissions

3. **Deployment Failures** (Future)
   - Check deployment credentials
   - Verify infrastructure configuration
   - Review deployment logs

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Testing**

   - Add end-to-end tests with Playwright
   - Implement performance testing
   - Add code coverage reporting

2. **Deployment Options**

   - AWS ECS deployment
   - Google Cloud Run deployment
   - Azure App Service deployment

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Add pipeline status notifications
   - Implement deployment health checks
   - Set up error tracking with Sentry
