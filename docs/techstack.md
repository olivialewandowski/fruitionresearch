# Tech Stack Documentation

This document outlines the core technologies and architectural decisions for our full-stack web application. The goal is to build a robust, scalable, and production-ready platform leveraging modern best practices across the frontend, backend, DevOps, and infrastructure layers. The tech stack was carefully chosen to support performance, developer experience, and long-term maintainability.

---

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is built for responsiveness, performance, and modern UX:

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**: Enables fast, SEO-friendly, server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) pages. Ideal for scalable frontend architecture.
- **React**: Composable, component-based UI foundation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for clean, responsive design.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight and performant global state management, ideal for handling auth, session, and app-wide state.
- **Zod**: Type-safe schema validation on both frontend and backend.
- **Lucide Icons / Radix UI**: For modern, accessible UI components and visuals.

These tools enable a seamless UI/UX and clean developer experience while maintaining flexibility for future feature growth.

## State Management and Validation

We use **Zustand** for global state management due to its performance and simplicity. This allows easy access to auth state, user roles, and other shared data across components without prop drilling or performance bottlenecks.

**Zod** is used for input validation both client- and server-side, ensuring all data entering the system is strongly typed and safe.

## Authentication and Authorization (RBAC)

- **Supabase Auth**: Secure JWT-based authentication with support for email/password, social login, and session management.
- **Auth Guards**: Custom route protection logic on both frontend (`useEffect`, HOCs) and backend (`requireAuth` middleware).
- **Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security)**: Enforces permission control directly in the database. Combined with middleware, it enables clean and scalable role-based access control (RBAC).

This setup provides a secure foundation for protecting both UI routes and backend resources.

---

## Database and Backend

- **Supabase Postgres**: Scalable, relational database with full SQL and RLS support.
- **Next.js API Routes**: Handle server-side logic and custom backend endpoints.
- **Supabase Storage**: For asset uploads (e.g., images), with signed URL access and permission control.
- **Winston Logging + Logtail**: Structured application-level logging for all backend operations. Logs are centralized, searchable, and connected to alerting tools.

We deliberately use Postgres for ACID compliance and Supabase for its BaaS simplicity, allowing rapid development without compromising on control.

---

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Jest**: For unit testing business logic and components.
- **Playwright**: End-to-end browser testing of flows (e.g., login, dashboard).
- **CI via GitHub Actions**: Linting, type checking, unit tests, and E2E testing before every deploy.

This ensures code reliability and prevents regressions at every commit.

---

## Containerization, CI/CD, and Deployment

- **Docker + Docker Compose**: Standardized containerization for local and cloud environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates build, test, and deploy workflows.
- **AWS (ECS + S3 + RDS optional)**: Scalable infrastructure, allowing full control of resources. Deployment targets ECS containers, assets go to S3, and RDS can be used if scaling beyond Supabase.

Infrastructure is modular and flexible to support both monolithic and microservice patterns in the future.

---

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Winston + Logtail**: App-level logs are written using Winston and piped to Logtail for centralized visibility.
- **Sentry (optional)**: Client-side and backend error tracking with stack traces and alerting.
- **Supabase Logs**: Captures database, auth, and storage logs (supplemental, not a replacement for app logs).

This ensures full observability across all layers of the system.

---

## Security Considerations

- RLS enforced at the DB level for secure multi-tenancy.
- JWTs used for all auth state; passed securely via HttpOnly cookies.
- API endpoints guarded by custom middleware.
- All secrets handled through `.env` in development and AWS Secrets Manager in production.

---

## Summary: Why This Stack Works

- Modern developer experience with Next.js, Tailwind, and Zustand
- Scalable auth and DB with Supabase + RLS + JWT
- Type-safe and validated through Zod
- Full CI/CD via GitHub Actions and Dockerized deployment to AWS
- Production-grade monitoring with Winston + Logtail
- Infrastructure flexible for scale, with clean code separation and modularity

This tech stack is designed not just to ship quickly, but to scale responsibly, maintain quality, and deliver secure, high-performing user experiences from day one.
